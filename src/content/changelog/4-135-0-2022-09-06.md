### Changed

* **IPv4 Address Delete** ([DELETE /linode/instances/{linodeId}/ips/{address}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#ipv4-address-delete))
  * This command can now be used to delete a Linode's private IPv4 address. Previously, only public IPv4 addresses could be deleted with this command.
