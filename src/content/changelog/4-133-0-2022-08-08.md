### Changed

* **Account View** ([GET /account](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#account-view))
  * The `billing_source` property has been added to this command's response, which specifies whether the Account has an Akamai-specific relationship.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug that allowed requests to create [Managed Databases](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/databases/) with an invalid number of nodes. Managed Databases can only be created with 1 or 3 nodes.
